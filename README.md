# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Induction Week and the Robot Olympiad

Robot Olympiad was interesting stuff to work with. Although I didn't understand what to do at first, I still got into that and tried to do my best despite not knowing the program that we worked with. Our team wasn't very concerned about this Olympiad and we only got the training points, not going deeper into that. Sadly enough, I wasn't that eager to continue the work as well, which, I think, is my main problem. I need to be more confident in what I'm doing.

## Week 1

From Concepts to Design and Commerce, An Introduction to Python Programming and PyGame, and Computing Fundamentals

Thinking of a new game's concept is always fun. Making up the game's mechanics, gameplay, etc. was interesting for me. I think we did good work with our team there, although I wasn't a big part of it. Next time I'm definitely going to make big effort for my team. The only thing that confused me there was commercial stuff that we had to do and calculate our budgets. I knew that indie companies are doing everything by themselves, but I didn't expect us to do commercial stuff so soon. That is where I was useless for my team. But at least this was a great opportunity to understand how hard it can be to calculate everything, especially when someone is working in a team of 5 people. Another thing I want to mention is Python. Python is completely new for me. Even though I am total novice at this language, I'm confident that I can master it. It will surely take some time, but eventually I will do that.

## Week 2

Tinkering Graphics, the Agile Philosophy, and Journal Articles in Computing

This week we were divided into pairs to do our tinkering graphics. At first, I wasn't sure whether I could do my best like that. But soon I understood that this is the only way I can learn Python as fast as possible. As I'm new to Python and PyGame in general, I wasn't sure what I was doing, but with the help of my partner, I could at least understand it. In addition, it was so interesting to see how he did different things, experiments, with our simple code. I definitely should spend more time studying individually.

Agile Philosophy was something incomprehensible to me. I can't tell whether I understood it clearly what Agile Philosophy is. Eventually, I assume, I will get it. The only thing to mention is that I don't have to wait until the very last moment, I should research that by myself. I must grow a habit of that...

## Week 3

Starting my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, Pitching my First Game Concept, and Version Control

First thing first, I was so glad to have a chance of presenting my game that I came up with. It wasn't so easy to make gameplay seem interesting, but that what makes it fun to create your own games. The only thing I struggled with a lot was commercials... I had to research how to calculate everything, which wasn't as exciting as everything else. But I'm glad to briefly understand what it looks like. Unfortunately, I didn't give enough effort in presenting my game. That's why it was denied. But that only means I have much to work with. And next time I will surely make a game that will make everyone tremble with delight.

I thought that our Assignment would take quite some time to make. But luckily, I am in a pair with experienced student, that surely knows what he is doing unlike me. Despite that I was trying to do my best even when not knowing some basics of Python. And with my partner's help I can surely tell, that he helped me a lot.

Version Control wasn't as hard as I expected. No doubt I can clearly understand how it works, although not everything yet, and why it is useful in every development teams.

## Week 4

Met my Team for the Game Development Project! More Programming and Learning about Logic and Academic Writing

Finally, we were divided into teams to make a game, which I was waiting for. Even though it's not as big of a project, but it's always fun to feel like you are a part of a good team. I'm happy to have this team, everyone is so friendly and communicative. Among such people, I also want to become more talkative, which I really lack of. That's a great opportunity to show myself as a good team member as well as learn from others: what they do and how, how they struggle and overcome the problem. This period of time while we are making this game will be a great experience for everyone. Especially for those who are total novices like me. I'm totally looking forward to seeing our final version of the game. Even if this won't be as great as we thought, which I refuse to think about, it will still be a great experience for us!

Programming was fun this week and I assume it will continue that way. Can't say the same for academic writing. This will be tough for me. Nonetheless, managing my time better and spending on writing enough time is eventually what I'm looking for.

## Week 5

Peer-review finished and first assignment finished! Learned more about academic writing and complexity theory

Reviewing others codes was interesting. Seeing some really creative approaches was exciting. I don't really know what to say more. I guess everyone was trying to make something creative, and so were we.

I was lucky to get Louis as my pair for programming. He is very experienced, unlike me, and can help me write a code at any time. As I'm not that good at managing my time yet, he always set our time for doing the tinkering graphics assignment, which really helped us make that earlier. Also, while doing this assginment, I learnt some basics from Louis. Thanks to him I can now contribute a little bit more for our game project.

Just for mentioning, learning some academic writing was useful, as I learnt how papers should look like and what we should avoid writing. This way I could concentrate on academically approached paper, which tutors are looking for when reviewing our papers, I guess. 

## Week 6

Spent the week with my team working in the studio! Made a lot of progress on the game...

This was some exciting time. We did quite a lot for our game, comparing to our sprint goal we should have done that week. Although not everyone was at the studio some days, but that's totally okay, as they could have had some other problems or they couldn't contribute enough. Good thing is, we still communicated a lot, so that everyone know what is up-to-date. First days of the week were productive, as we were coming to the studio for a couple of hours for coding and doing stand-ups. Even after completing the user stories that were to be done during the sprint, we continued working and implementing some other features. Everyone was making what he thought would be nice to see in the game or just was committed to make a particular thing (that's me! :]). Although I didn't make that by myself, I mean that I was looking for some codes on the internet, but this is at least something. I mean, even though I looked on the internet, I still learnt from that. I can partially understand some functions or how to make a specific code or something else...

## Week 7

Presenting out Agile Research as a team. Starting new section in tinkering - Audio!

To be fair, we did our presentation at the same day when we had to present that. I tried to make that before, but ended up the same. Although I started one day before presenting, but didn't finish. Oh well, that still wasn't that bad! The worst part is that I still didn't know exactly what I would be writing about. But thanks to our tutors feedback, I changed my topic to look more academically (if that's the word) and understood what I should be concentrating on. So, after all, this was a great opportunity to change whatever should be changed. That's weird, isn't it? ...

After finishing our first tinkering assignment, we started audio! New pairs - new challenges. Audio is a weird thing in coding terms, I guess. I still can't understand how we should present that to our tutor. I mean, how should all that be made... I assume this won't be as hard as the graphics one, but it surely will be a weird experience. Well, we will se how it goes! :]

## Week 8

WARNING! Agile Essay and Research Journal Deadlines!

This week was terrible for everyone... None of us could contribute even a little to our game. All of us were concentrated on essays. I just don't have much to say at this point. We were just trying to reach that word limit together with some meaningfulness in it, so we had something for the peer reviews. To be fair, I'm not good at reviewing papers. Not that I can't review them at all, I just cannot give a good feedback. I can only say that some particular text is irrelevant or something else is wrong. I cannot suggest how one should change his paper. But I guess I'll manage this during our first peer-reviews. Also, I got a good feedback from my peer so I could improve my agile essay. As well as reviewing other papers, not only our peers, but also some previous year's ones, I understood, what my mistakes were at that moment. Thus, I could change my essay AND remember it so I know how to write the next essays. But eventually we did it! :]

## Week 9

Ending of first game development and new team announcement!

Finally we have finished our first game together. This was a very good experience, and of course, a game to work on. I don't know if everyone is satisfied with the result, but we definitely did well. Although I have to admit, we didn't do everything we expected for that period, which, I suppose, is okay. However it was pleasant to work with those guys. I learnt a lot from them. To be fair, I love how everything is being done in the University. I would never have thought, that we will work in groups to make games from the very beginning. And that's what the most satisfying for me here. I love it. I love working that way. Not like I want others to do my job, definitely not, but it's much more efficient this way. I wish i had more inspiration working in groups. But I guess I'll improve in this field quite fast during my first year.

As we have finally finished our first game, everybody saw an announcement, that we are being divided into groups, again, of 9-10 people from different categories of game development. This is so cool. Can't wait to start working with them. Luckily, in our group the 3 programmers are the same as from the previous team. This will make me feel more comfortable, as it takes some time for me to get used to new people. But when there are some that I know well already, it makes it more easier. However, I feel like others are nice as well, but we will see that next week, as we will have a meeting then. I hope it goes well.

## Week 10

Presenting our game, meeting new people and reviewing others audio codes

This week we have presented out game, which quite impressive compared to some others, not gonna lie. Although none of the games were full games, which is expected, but it still was fun. However, unfortunately, we had some problems during the presentation. And only our team... This was a bit embarrassing. But whatever... Our team is still happy we could do so much and learn from each other. Especially, those who knew little about the programming.

This week I also met our new team, new people, which were very enthusiastic about the cooperative work we are going to do this whole semester. Each of them has their own preferences, which is amazing. I can learn so much from all of them. Especially things that I couldn't even think about before. Well, we will see that later, when we start working on our game. But for now this is only expectations, which usually are wrong. Let's not think negatively, shall we? :)

There was also an audio review lesson. As all the previous reviews, it went okey. Some codes were working, some not understandable at all. Those are just unfinished after all.

## Week 11

Game's concept brain-storming, starting Unreal Engine and Worksheet D review!

This week, our team has brain-stormed a lot of ideas for our upcoming game. Unfortunately, I couldn't keep up with all the ideas. That's why I couldn't suggest any of mine, because I didn't have any... This is my problems during brain-storming. I rarely have any ideas, until we start doing something. 

Before starting Unreal Engine here, in University, I have introduced myself briefly to that. However, I know that's not enough to know coding there well. But that's why I'm studying here! To learn. By the way, we are doing our next game in Unreal Engine, which is fortunate for me, as I not only will learn it from my mates, but also in lessons.

For the last thing - worksheet D was our tic-tac-toe code. Surprisingly, it went well for me, which I didn't expect. Also, thanks to others, that gave me example of how I could find a winner there. Luckily, I understood and implemented that. For the review lesson itself?... It was no different than the others. We just talked through the possible ways of doing that, and somebody even showed us his solution.

## Week 12

Last week of the term! HOLIDAYS

We had still brain-stormed this week to have a final thoughts about the game. Luckily, everyone was happy with what we are going to make. Why luckily? Well, everyone has his own preferences to what he or she wants to make, and they might be very different from others, which would make the game impossible to make, or at least would not make any sense. But, as I mentioned, everything went good, and we have a final version of the game we are going to make. I hope it goes the same way when we start actually making it. Fingers crossed!

After having a final thought about the game, we had to make a pitch itself to present it this week. Everyone had his role, except for me. I so hate myself for not being active and having no ideas in these situations. I couldn't think of anything that would help our team, even when others suggested what I should research... I'm so useless... But, I shouldn't be so negatively thoughtful. I think, remembering this situation, will lead me to better understanding of what I should do next time we start making a game. Yes, thinking like that, would make much more sense in self-development... or improvement, whatever.


# 2nd Semester

## Week 1

New semester, meeting new team and starting our game project.

Winter holidays have ended and now we start our new semester, I wonder what exciting stuff will be now. We've been told our next assignmets for COMP130 and COMP140, and the first few assignments for COMP130 are quite similar to the previous semester's ones, although with no quizzes this time. 

Before this semester has started, we have met our new team, who we are going to start a game project with. I'm always having problems with meeting new people and being talkative, so I had this feeling of not knowing them and, therefore, felt like I'm not needed there, as I always feel. But, because I'm used to that, I started trying to make at least some progress in self-development. We have already been thinking of a game, that we are planning to make, but couldn't make our minds. So, this took us a few weeks, we were making up totally different ideas from the previous ones, overscoping and also trying to make it simple, but still didn't come to a conclusion. Although a brief understanding of what everyone wants to see in our game we already had. It was just a matter of time when we decide on a game!

## Week 2

Starting prototyping our game and still making up game ideas.

I've recently started making our game's prototype knowing that it's going to be in Unreal and top-down view. So, first thing I could do is make player's character movements and maybe play a bit with blueprints to see what I could do with it later. To be honest, there was nothing really special or problematic this week, as we were just concluding what the game will be about, while I was starting to get some stuff going on, so we could all start making our game as soon as we decide on the mechanics. And at the end of this week, we've decided on most things, but this could change later on in the development.

## Week 3

Game starting to grow and new problems occuring

While we work on our game all together, it surely starting to grow into some kind of a game. Although not without problems. I think we are a good team, having nice communication between everyone and everything, but we were having some troubles with merging all our stuff into one Unreal project, as we were all working on the separate ones. So this caused us a lot of time-wasting research due to our bad knowledge of Unreal Engine. I hope everything goes well later and we can work on a single project.

In addition, we were introduced to our COMP130 Software Engineering essay assignment. Honestly, I have no idea what I'm going to write about. And most likely I'll come to an idea and start writing at the very last week. Hopefully, this will go less stressful as it was the previous semester...

## Week 4

Meeting another team and more problems with Unreal

This week we have met a new 1st year team that are working in Unity. Before having met with them, we had problems with building Unreal to show our product. This was such a pain for some of our teammates, because we didn't want to load Unreal editor, wait a few minutes till it compiles (if it compiles at all) and then play it there. But, eventually, it went alright. Even though we've had a few "game features", which shouldn't be in the game, the other team liked it and suggested to keep it. Well, I agree, that it was funny to deflect your own bullets while deflecting enemy bullets. We'll consider that whether we should keep it.

Moreover, we still don't have any idea about our main character and what is the progress. Our artist decided to make the player character model, but we haven't heard anything about that and how it goes. We hope everything goes well with it and we can soon see atleast "work-in-progress" model.

## Week 5

This week we have our software engineering research proposal review. Even though I have written it, of course, I'm still not sure what I want to write about. My research question is kind of boring, I guess, and requires some boring researching... So, I'm going to change this topic as soon as I understand what I really want to write about. Although I think I'll keep AI as the main topic. Moreover, I have started working on AI in our game, so this will be a good research experience, if I find something interesting about AI in games. In addition, this would probably help me create AI in our game more intelligent... or at least so that it fits our game pace.

## Week 6

Reading week and continuing AI development in the game.

This time it's reading week, so nothing special happened. Basically, still researching what topic I should write about and how to make it not as boring for me as it is expected to be. Oh God... next week we have to show our presentations for our essay. This is going to be bad as I don't know what exactly I'm going to write about. At least I know that it's going to be about AI. So, I can briefly present what I think should be or is going to be written in my essay.

Besides reading, we have our supervised studio practice, where we continue working on our game. And I'm continuing developing better AI for the game as well as learning more about it, so I can write about that in my essay. Nice. Starting to improve our shooting enemies, which are the most important. And I need to make them strafe while shooting at the player. I hope I'll manage to do that in a few days, because I'm still learning behaviour trees and how to make the most efficient.

## Week 7

Software engineering research presentation, show and tell day and more game development.

This week was kind of intense due to software presentation and show and tell day. So, for the presentation, I think it went alrgiht, though not knowing the exact research question (still...). But this did not prevented me from doing the presentation and talking about it. Although I think half of it will be irrelevant to my actual essay... And I think, I also noticed some stuff from others' presentations that could be relevant for me.

Show and Tell day was fun to see everyone's games in development, how they have right now and how they might improve later on. Same for our game. Although the trailer has been made at the last possible minute (as it always is...), it actually went pretty well. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be that smooth. And after the presentation, during a break, a friend of mine and his team from 2nd year told me that they really liked the concept of the game and wanted to see it's final version by the end of the semester. Also suggesting some interesting mechanics that could possibly fit our game. Moreover Douglas Brown also voted for us and said that our game was pretty fun, at least from the look of it.

## Week 8

Software engineering essay peer review and actual deadline and meeting another team again.

This week and previous weekend were kind of stressful due to essay deadline and because I formed a research question just a week before the actual deadline... As I expected, I have done this again - doing the actual work at the very last week, which I should try to avoid in the future. I'm glad the essay is done andeverything that's left is our game and custom controller game. To be honest, there were moments where I genuinely thought I won't make this essay until the deadline, but fortunately I made it and everything is fine now!

This week we have also met another team, which we have met a few weeks ago, but unfortunately I couldn't come, so I don't really have anything to say about it. I don't know how their game changed since I saw it on Show and Tell day the other week, but I hope everything is going alright for them as well.

## Week 9 

Basically more game polishing.

This week we were all basically just improving and polishing whatever should be and maybe adding some new stuff. Personally I was continuing working on AI, trying to fix our shooting enemies, because they were not working as intended. But thanks to James Collins, a good lad, who specialises on AI being 2nd year, helped me fix that and now it all works perfectly! I'm so glad there's this man in the academy. :) Nonetheless, I still have to add some behaviour to other enemies and maybe see how this could be improved before we hand-in the game. Hopefully all goes fine and nothing will be broken at the hand-in date...

## Week 10

Showing our game to the class and fast approaching deadlines for our game project and custom controller game

This week we have shown out games to each other and that was exciting to see what others have done throughout this semester. Some of them were good and fun to play, some are definitely unfinihsed and could be more exciting if they put more effort into that, but that's in the past and only their experience. Nonetheless, I like working on the game and I think we did good job there with all the others in the team. But it's still not the end and we have a week left to polish our game! Because we have the deadline next Tuesday, so we have to do our best till then.

Moreover, the custom game controller deadline is also early next week. And I have just started making it... I afraid I get stressful about it later in the week and wont't make it as desired. That's the biggest thing I hate in myself - starting actual work at the last possible moment with ton of stress... I definitely need to do something about it, so I don't get this experience on my second year. Maybe putting some on my personal whiteboard to remember all the deadlines and work I need to do. Nevertheless, I totally need to work on myself with this problem.

## Week 11

Two biggest deadlines handed-in and 1st year soon to be finished!

Previous week was kind of stressful, as I expected, same as this week's Monday, when we had to hand-in the custom game controller assignment. For the whole day I was working on the game and controller, so that it makes some sense of both of these. Thanks to everybody that helped me with this, especailly Al and a friend of mine, that was giving me a mental support, which I really needed... And this is all behind now, but I need not forget that this is bad experience to be in and I need to work on that so I don't get stressed out in the future about the assignments. I just need to manage my time so that I have enough time to actually work on the assignment bit by bit.

Also, out team project game has also handed-in this week. This was a great experience to work with others, communicate and make an actual game, maybe not as good, but this our 1st year after all. And we still have the PO meeting next week, as it was postponed because Brian was busy, to discuss what we did good and maybe give some feedback/criticism to others' work, so we all can improve and make a better game next study year! I just hope everyone takes it easy and also could give some criticism to others :)

## Week 12

Actually the end of the semester! *balloons and fireworks everywhere!*

To be honest, this is basically the last week we have lectures, except for the next week with game demos and programming vivas. So I really don't have anything to report, because this week was just a relaxing one, even though we still have CPD report to write, but that's not a problem. To be fair, this study year has ended really fast. Faster than any of the other years, which were school years for me. Maybe because we were working on game in our 1st year and that was exciting? Nonetheless, I really enjoyed making games with others, especially this semester when we had 9 people in the team working on Unreal and having different things to make dependant on our course. So far I'm really enjoying this :)
