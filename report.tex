\section{Introduction}

Write your introduction here. A brief introduction of about 100 words is recommended, which should state your career goal and the five key skills that you wish to highlight from your weekly reports. When choosing which skills to focus on for this report, be specific. Avoid choosing broad skills that are clearly important for any student, such as \textit{time management} or \textit{communication}. Instead, make it more granular. Consider which specific aspects of these broad areas are a priority for you, personally, and what may have caused or exacerbated the challenge. Tutors are not assessing your knowledge of general study skills. Rather, they are assessing your ability to analyse and reflect on your own learning and personal development as an individual and towards becoming a computing professional.

Second semester of my first year was harder than the first one bringing me more challenges and irritation in my bad self-improvement. Unlike the previous semester, this time I got more stressed about the two assignments, which were essay and custom game controller. Although, I managed to hand it in on time, but this was bad experience for me, as I was doing everything at the last moment. So, for this reason, I will do my best at summer and during my second year to improve my skills as a professional.

\section{First Key Skill}

Write about 200 words about. Remember, this is should be reflective and personal to you. Justify the relevance and importance of each of these skills with insight into your personal goals and personal circumstances. Assess your application of the skill throughout the semester and critically reflect on upon their impact it has had on your work and the challenges/obstacles. Acknowledge difficulties. Then, suggest how to overcome the challenge/obstacle in relation to a SMART action. When planning such actions, do not be too general. Consider SMART actions:
specific; measurable; achievable; relevant; and time-bound. Ensure that your proposed action for future development meets all five of these criteria.

My most challenging skill to improve would be to start talking to others - giving them my opinion about things and genuinely caring about different stuff. This would really help both me and the team I will be working with. As right now I'm not really interested in a lot of things and can't start a conversation, because I never have anything to ask. Although, I suppose this is more personality-related, but, nevertheless, this could also be improved at some point. And to do so, I will try talking to people I have just met, for example our next year team, to better know them and understand what to expect from them. Even though, this is not SMART, but I don't really know how else I could bound myself so that it is SMART. I suppose, this is more improve-as-you-grow, but I still going to do my best to faster improve my communication skills, because they are really poor, to be fair. And I hope next year will definitely help me with such self-improvement!

\section{Fifth Key Skill}

\section{Conclusion}

Write your conclusion here. Though the conclusion should be brief, no more than 100 words, it should do more than merely summarise the report. Focus on the five SMART actions that you intend to take in order to overcome any challenges and/or obstacles. Contextualise how this will help you towards your intended career goal and how this may improve your project for the next semester.
